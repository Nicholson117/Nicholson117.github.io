    <!--intro-->

    <div class="intro">
        <p>I started learning to code when i bought my first HTML & CSS book on the 14<sup>th</sup> of April 2020.
            I decided that this was the perfect time to throw myself into learning
            the basics of web development as i was furloughed due to the covid19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>The main purpose of this page is to allow me to apply and practice the everything im learning.

        <p>
            I had no idea how hard learning web development would be as i have never realy had a job that even involves
            computers,
            however i have always been intrested in engineering previously as i worked as a railway welding engineer and
            also did
            some work as an electical test engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was however more difficult than i first anticipated and the recources above helped massively,
            esplecially code academy as they was kind enough to donate a 3 month pro membership due to the position i
            was in with work.
